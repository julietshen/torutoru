### Product "Why"
Torutoru is for people entering Gujarati-speaking families and communities where language is love. Unlike other apps, it teaches you how to **greet your in-laws**, **enjoy dinner conversations**, and **feel part of traditions**, not just memorize flashcards of vocabulary that may not be relevant.

### Problems Solved
- Most Gujarati apps are academic, outdated, or unintuitive.
- No app currently focuses on relationship- and family-centered vocabulary.
- Learners are often discouraged by the Gujarati script alone. Torutoru uses Romanization by default.
- Addresses the cultural challenges of being a newcomer to language and tradition.

### User Experience Goals
- Friendly onboarding with zero-pressure learning
- Bold, warm design that reflects fun and not formality
- Simple nav and clear CTAs for mobile and web
- Gentle reinforcement (quizzes, flashcards) without penalizing mistakes
